    <h2>
    Hi! As the title suggests, I'm Phillip!
    </h2>
    <p>I'm a 20 year old looking to get a role relating to IT, whether it be hardware or software!
        While my website is not impressive, my knowledge of computer hardware and software certainly makes up for it. I'm planning to get certified in CompTIA A+ and Network+ as soon as possible.
    </p>

<a target="#certifications">
    <h2>What can I do?</h2>
    <p>I have multiple certifications including (but soon not limited to): Microsoft Office Specialist Expert and Master for Office 365 and 2016, respectively, and Microsoft Operating System Fundamentals. Below you can see the certificates for yourself.</p>

<a target="#experience"></a>

<h2 text-align:left> Where have I been so far?</h2>
<p>From September 2021 to August 2022, I worked at the Amazon Fulfillment site BHM1 in the following roles, Directed Pack AFE, Waterspider, Outbound Sort, Mix Pack, and Outbound Pick. I originally planned to apply for a role in their IT department, but I decided to part ways with Amazon to persue an outside company for my IT dreams.</p>

<h2>What am I working on now?</h2>
<p>Well, you're looking at my main project! I've been working on my website to improve my skills in HTML and CSS. I hope to also work further on my skills with Python.</p>
